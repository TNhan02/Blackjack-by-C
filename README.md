This is a basic blackjack game code by C language.

The cards have the same points as their values (independent of suit). A (ace) has a value of 11, on the other hand, J (Jack), Q (Queen), K (King) have values of 10.

Each player and the computer begin with 2 cards. There is a 'Hit or Stand' option for every additional card. If you hit, you get one more card, your point is added, and it goes until you stay. The safe range for player is 16 to 21, while that of computer is 15 to 21. At the end, the player(s) with larger point than computer wins, but a tie can also happen.
